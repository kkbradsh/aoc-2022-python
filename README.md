# AdventOfCode 2022 - Python

## Description

Of the good, the bad, and the ugly, this is the ugly ... I mean it works, so it can't be all bad ... lol. This is the code that I wrote for [Advent Of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## Running the code

- The file structure is ./src/[day]/[part], e.g. ./src/01/01 for day 1, part 1.
- Change into the folder containing the code to run.
- Run `py ./index.py main` to run the final result.
- Run `py -m unittest` to run the test result.
